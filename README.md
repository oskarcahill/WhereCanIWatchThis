# WhereCanIWatchThis

WhereCanIWatchThis was developed to make searching for movies and tv shows a simple process. I developed the application when, upon wanting to find out where I could watch a movie or tv show, I found the process to be time consuming and unreliable. Instead of opening up a browser and searching through web apps to find where content could be found, including inputing location etc, this mobile app can get you results in a few clicks. 

App is currently functional for the UK and Ireland.

## Stack

Frontend - React Native 

Backend - Express, Cheerio

## Installation

First clone the repository using git clone.

Then install necessary packages 

```bash
npm install 
```

App can then be run by starting both server and frontend with the following command 

```bash
npm run android / npm run ios
```
